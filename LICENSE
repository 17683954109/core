BETA TEST LICENSE

By downloading this software you (the "Licensee") agree to this beta test license.

A. Cloud9 IDE, Inc (the "Vendor") is in the process of developing a new version of the Cloud9 software product (the "Pre-Release Software"), which Vendor hopes to market in the near future.

B. Vendor would like to field-test a preliminary version of its Pre-Release Software so as to further refine and modify the product before it is generally released.

C. Licensee has expressed an interest in licensing a copy of the Pre-Release Software in advance of its general release in order to evaluate the Pre-Release Software for its own purposes and to assist Vendor in refining and modifying the Pre-Release Software so that it becomes more useful for its intended market ("Beta Test").

D. In exchange for early access to the Pre-Release Software, Licensee agrees to serve as a Beta Test site for the Pre-Release Software and to provide Vendor with its comments, criticisms, suggestions, and evaluations with respect to the Pre-Release Software during the Beta Test period.

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereby agree as follows:

1. LICENSE GRANT

Vendor grants to Licensee, during the term of this Agreement, a temporary, non-exclusive license to use an executable version of the Pre-Release Software and its related documentation, for evaluation purposes. Licensee may make copies of the Pre-Release Software for back-up purposes only, provided that Licensee reproduces Vendor's copyright and other proprietary rights notices on all such copies. This license does not include any rights to disclose, sublicense, or otherwise transfer the Pre-Release Software, related documentation, or other proprietary information of Vendor.

2. BETA TEST

Licensee understands and acknowledges that (i) it is participating in Vendor's Beta Test for the Pre-Release Software, (ii) it is receiving a preliminary version of the Pre-Release Software, and (iii) the Pre-Release Software may not operate properly, may not perform all functions for which it is intended or represented, and may not operate error-free.
